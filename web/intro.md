# Urban Transport Modelling for Sustainable Well-Being in Hanoi (UTM-Hanoi)

## Project summary

Many cities - such as Hanoi in Vietnam - are expanding rapidly,
but formal infrastructure is failing to keep pace with the burgeoning population.
This is further complicated by the emergence of informal transport infrastructures
that develop in areas of unplanned urban sprawl.

This project proposes an innovative process that interlinks new data collection,
modelling and policy development. By working with policy makers at the highest
levels of government (including the Head of the Department for Transport), this
project aims to address questions regarding how, where, and when planned policies
should be implemented (if at all), what the impacts on local communities would
be, whether public transport can cope, and whether there are better alternatives

Successful policies will dramatically improve the well-being for all citizens
in Hanoi by reducing pollution and providing more equitable access to opportunities.
