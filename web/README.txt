The website is built using jupyter-book. To build it type:

jupyter-book build .

If you add new content it needs to be listed in the table of contents (_toc.yml)

There are workflows in github that build the book automatically and publish it using github.io. See the files at: https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/UTM-Hanoi/tree/main/.github/workflows
