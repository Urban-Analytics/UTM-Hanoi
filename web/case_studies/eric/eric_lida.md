# Possible Impacts of a Motorbike Ban on Transport in Hanoi

Author: _Eric Wanjau_

---

Why is it that in a Megacity with 8 million people, 90% of the vehicles
driven are motorbikes? What are the underlying factors influencing
individuals' travel behaviors and attitudes towards a proposed motorbike
ban? What would be the impact of such a ban on the flows associated with
other transport modes? This research addresses the aforementioned
questions.

---

## Project overview

An overwhelming majority of inhabitants in Hanoi city use motorbikes as
their primary means of transport. To put this into context, as of 2015
Hanoi had 4.9 million motorbikes and there are two and a half motorbikes
per person (Van, 2009). One potential solution that has been suggested
is to ban motorbikes in some areas of the city. However, with the
current overwhelming use of motorbikes, any future ban will need support
from the public to be successful. This 6-month project aimed at creating
statistical and spatial models of transport behaviors and attitudes in
relation to a potential motorbike ban. The aim of the modeling was to
help policymakers predict the impact of different transport policy
changes and to understand the process driving different travel
behaviors. The models implemented were:

 - A Modal Spatial Interaction Model to investigate the modal shift of
    flows if a ban were implemented.

 - A boosted trees Classification Model aimed at predicting
    individuals' attitudes towards the proposed ban and investigating
    the underlying factors/reasons.

The models along with other exploratory analyses were presented to
policymakers using an interactive R shiny dashboard developed by LIDA
data scientist Kristina Bratkova.

## Data and methods

The main data set used in this study is a bespoke transport survey of
30, 000 residents that was undertaken to capture the dynamics and trends
of people's regular travel in and around the city, including the
attitudes towards different transport modes and a proposed motorbike
ban. The travel survey collected data such as general information (e.g.
age, location), travel behaviour (e.g. origin-destination trips, means
of transport) and attitudes towards the ban (e.g. opinion on the ban,
alternative vehicle if ban is implemented).

The classification model development workflow involved some Exploratory
Data Analysis (such as Fig1), feature engineering (reformatting
predictor values to make them easier for a model to use effectively),
model training, tuning and evaluation, and finally probing the model to
investigate variable importance and why the model makes the predictions
it does. An Extreme Boosted Trees (XGBoost) model was used to classify
individual respondents into two groups: those who agree and those who
disagree with the potential motorbike ban. The model achieved the
evaluation metrics shown in Fig2 and Table1.

| ![Map of spatial distribution of respondents](fig1.jpg "Figure 1")                                   |
| --                                                                                                   |
| Figure 1: How opinions varied based on home location with larger blobs representing more respondents |

| Figure 2: Confusion matrix.              |




Table 1: Evaluation metrics:

|  Metric        | Value |
|  ------------- | ------- |
|  Accuracy      | 0.878 |
|  Recall        | 0.853 |
|  Specificity   | 0.919 |
| PPV            | 0.945 |
| F-measure      | 0.897 |
|  ROC\_AUC      | 0.953 |


The model's performance was quite impressive: the accuracy shows that
the model predicts accurately 87.8% of the test data, has an 85.3%
probability of detecting a person would agree with the ban (recall) and
91.9% probability of detecting a person would disagree with the ban
(specificity). Some of the techniques used to achieve the metrics above
include:

-   Feature engineering techniques such as creating dummy variables,
    dealing with zero and near zero variance predictors, dealing with
    infrequently occurring observations etc.

-   Up sampling the training set since the data was imbalanced (having
    less number of respondents who disagreed with the ban)

-   Spatial cross-validation resampling to account for the presence of
    spatial autocorrelation in geospatial data.

-   Tuning XGBoost hyperparameters to obtain the combinations that lead
    to the best metrics and avoid over-fitting.

-   Using an ANOVA-based racing method for efficient tuning of model
    hyperparameters

In-depth explanations and accompanying code of the above are discussed
in an upcoming paper (*Factors affecting perceptions in transport - A
deep dive into the motorbike ban in Hanoi, Vietnam*) that will be
submitted to an academic journal and shared in the project's repository:
<https://urban-analytics.github.io/UTM-Hanoi/intro.html>

This study also implemented a modal spatial interaction model that
unlike previous studies, combines trip distribution characteristics and
modal choice, allowing one to simulate the number of journeys made from
origin zones to the destination zones by a particular transport mode.
The model is presented below:

$$T_{\text{ij}}^{m} = \ A_{i}^{m}O_{i}^{m}B_{j}D_{j}d_{\text{ij}}^{m^{{- \beta}_{m}}}
$$

$T_{\text{ij}}^{m}$ is the number of trips from origin *i* to
destination *j* using mode *m*

**​**$A_{i}^{m}$ is the total number of trips generated at origin
zone *i* by mode *m*

**​**$B_{j}$ is *the total number of trips attracted at destination j*

$d_{\text{ij}}^{m^{{- \beta}_{m}}}$ is the cost (distance) of making a
trip from origin *i* to destination *j* using mode *m*

$A_{i}^{m}$ and $B_{j}$ are known as balancing factors where $A_{i}^{m}$
ensures that the predicted modal interaction flows leaving each origin
equal the known value $O_{i}^{m}$ and $B_{j}$ ensures that the total
predicted interaction flows arriving at each destination equal the known
value $D_{j}$

Detailed theoretical and mathematical underpinnings of spatial
interaction models are discussed in an upcoming paper (*Spatial
Interaction Modelling for Modal Shift: Application in an Emerging
Mega-City*) that will be submitted to an academic journal and shared in
the project's repository:
<https://urban-analytics.github.io/UTM-Hanoi/intro.html>

Once the model parameters were calibrated and fit to the data, the
following performance metrics were obtained:

|  metric   | estimate |
|  -------- | ---------- |
| rmse      | 10.2       |
| rsq       | 0.589      |

This indicates that on average, incorrect predictions are wrong by
around 10 flows and the model can explain about 59% of the variability
in the data, which was considered close enough to reproducing the
original flow matrix.

## Key findings

### Classification Model Results

After obtaining satisfactory performance from the XGBoost model, this
research then sought to explore the underlying factors driving the
model's predictions. One of the model interpretation techniques
implemented was SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP shows the
importance of variables by comparing the model's prediction with and
without the variable in every possible order. The SHAP summary plot
combines feature importance and feature effects with features being
ordered according to their importance and colored according to the value
of the feature from low to high as shown in Fig3:

| ![SHAP summary plot](fig3.png "Figure 3")                                                |
| ---                                                                                      |
| Figure 3: SHAP summary plot. Shapley values \> 0 push the model towards 'agree' outcome. |
 

Some inferences we can derive from the Shapley plot are:

-   *Freq\_car\_X0* (a dummy variable with a value of 1 if the
    respondent uses a car 0 times a week and 0 otherwise) has the
    largest effect on the model's prediction. If a respondent does not
    use a car (*Freq\_car\_X0* equals 1 and purple color) then they are
    less likely to agree with the ban as indicated by the low (negative)
    SHAP values.

-   The second most important variable is the distance to public
    transport *(dist\_to\_pub)* which is a numeric variable. It appears
    that larger distances to public transport are associated with the
    disapproval of the motorbike ban.

-   Respondents who considered cars as an alternative vehicle in case of
    a motorbike ban (*tf\_alt\_veh\_car*) are more likely to approve the
    motorbike ban and hints at the growing popularity of cars in Hanoi.

-   Socio-demographic attributes such as age, gender, and occupation do
    not have a significant effect on the model outcomes.

SHAP summary plot give us first indications of the relationship between
a feature and the impact on predictions. We can take a closer look at
the exact form of the relationship by making SHAP dependence plot as
shown in Fig4:

| ![SHAP dependence plots](fig4.png)                                  |
| ---                                                                 |

### Spatial Interaction Model Results

One of the survey questions was: *What would be your alternative vehicle
for this trip if a motorbike ban was enacted?* To estimate the change in
modal flows in the case of a ban, the Spatial Interaction Model was
altered in the following way:

1.  An alternative vehicle for each motorbike user was randomly selected
    from their responses

2.  The new alternative vehicles were plugged back into the flow matrix
    to estimate new values of $O_{i}^{m}$ (the total number of trips
    generated at origin zone *i* by mode *m*)

3.  The modal SIM was recalibrated to obtain new values for the
    balancing factors $A_{i}^{m}B_{j}$

4.  The multiplicative formula
    $T_{\text{ij}}^{m} = \ A_{i}^{m}O_{i}^{m}B_{j}D_{j}d_{\text{ij}}^{m^{{- \beta}_{m}}}$
    was used to obtain new scenario modal flows.

The table below shows an example of a motorbike ban scenario:

| vehicle   | Flows before ban   | Flows after ban   | Change in flows   |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| taxi      | 99                 | 2652              | 2553              |
| car       | 5060               | 7294              | 2234              |
| bus       | 110                | 1887              | 1777              |
| ebike     | 876                | 2132              | 1256              |
| bike      | 870                | 2080              | 1210              |
| walk      | 287                | 1131              | 844               |
| moto      | 9868               | 0                 | -9868             |

In this scenario, majority of the flows previously associated with
motorbikes would result to taxis, cars and buses and only a small number
to walking. With this information, more downstream analyses can be
performed for each particular mode. For instance, the map below in Fig5
shows the change in flows at destinations associated with ebikes in the
event of a motorbike ban.

| ![Map of change in ebike destinations](fig5.png "Figure 5")                  |
| ---                                                                          |
| Figure 5: Change in flows at ebike destinations as a result of motorbike ban |


More importantly, the changes in routes taken by various vehicles from
origin zones to destination zones can be observed. The maps below in
Fig6 show the routes taken by ebike users weighted by the number of
flows before and after the ban.

| ![Map of routes weighted by flows](fig6.png "Figure 6")                                           |
| ---                                                                                               |
| Figure 6: Map of routes weighted by flows. Left: before motorbike ban. Right: After motorbike ban |

Using the analyses above, policymakers are able to estimate the impact
of a motorbike ban on the existing modes of transport used in the city,
origin and destination zones, and corresponding routes/infrastructure.

## Value of the research

As outlined earlier, an overwhelming majority of Hanoi residents use
motorbikes as their primary means of transport. The effects of such a
large number and high density of motorbikes has led to severe problems
such as traffic congestion, and noise and air pollution. To this effect,
a motorbike ban has been proposed in some areas of the city. This
research could support policymakers in the following ways:

a.  The classification model developed (with an 89% accuracy on an
    unbalanced test set) could help policymakers predict individuals'
    perceptions to the ban.

b.  Leveraging on the various model explainability techniques used in
    this research, policymakers can identify the most and least
    important factors driving perceptions towards the ban and develop
    appropriate policies.

c.  Using the spatial interaction model, policymakers can simulate modal
    flows in the case of a ban, the resulting modal changes of flows at
    various communes, and the impacts on the existing infrastructure.

d.  Using the models and exploratory data analysis implemented in this
    research, policymakers can make more informed decisions with regards
    to the motorbike ban, identify policies that could lead to adoption
    of more environmental friendly modes of transport, and a glimpse of
    how flows within the city would shift.

e.  Code notebooks, data and methodologies implemented in this research
    will be released to the wider research community.

**Insights**

a.  Current usage and future consideration of cars as a means of
    transport is an important factor driving individuals\' perception of
    the motorbike ban. However, this is undesirable since it could
    potentially worsen the traffic congestion and pollution in the city.

b.  Respondents who considered using the newly established tram lines
    are also more likely to agree with the ban of motorbikes.

c.  Spatial variables such as home location (*home\_lon, home\_lat*)
    play important roles in individuals' perception of the motorbike
    ban, with respondents of certain areas agreeing to the ban more than
    others and vice versa.

d.  Survey respondents who are aware of the ban are more likely to agree
    to it and vice versa. This shows the need for public sensitization
    and involvement in the formulation of such policies if they are to
    be widely accepted and adopted.

e.  From the Spatial Interaction Model: the usage of cars increases with
    increase in the trip distance while that of buses decreases with
    increase in trip distance. Improving public transport within the
    city could potentially result in a decrease in the use of private
    vehicles.

f.  The modal Spatial Interaction Model gives a glimpse of the impact of
    the motorbike ban on existing modes of transport but also raises an
    important question: would the existing road infrastructure keep up?
